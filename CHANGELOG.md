# Change Log

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/Hout/JHDate/tree/0.5.0) (2015-11-08)

- Implemented ``Hashable & Equatable`` protocols
- Separate implementation files for various protocols
- Added weekend functions: ``nextWeekend(), previousWeekend, inWeekend`` incl all tests
- Made testing possible with other default regions, calendars
